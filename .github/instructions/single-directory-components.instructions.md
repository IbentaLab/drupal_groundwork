# ðŸ§± Single Directory Components (SDC)

Selfâ€‘contained components with Twig, CSS, JS (optional), YAML.

- Location: `components/<name>/`
- Ideal for hero banners, accordions, modals, etc.

## Rules
1. Use BEM internally.
2. Use tokens for colors/spacing.
3. Register libraries if CSS/JS needed.
4. Provide component docs and ensure WCAG compliance.
