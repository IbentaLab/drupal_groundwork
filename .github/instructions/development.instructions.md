# ðŸ”§ Development Guidelines

- Vanilla CSS only â€” no SCSS/build tools.
- Organize CSS: base â†’ layout â†’ BSC/HSC â†’ components â†’ theme.
- JS: vanilla, scoped via Drupal.behaviors.
- Place new CSS/JS/Twig in correct layer; refactor to SDC when markup/logic needed.
- Always use tokens and BEM naming.
