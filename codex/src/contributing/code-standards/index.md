# Groundwork Code Standards

Welcome to the Groundwork Code Standards. This section provides the official, detailed guidelines for writing high-quality code for the Groundwork Theme Framework. These are not just arbitrary rules; they are the principles that directly support our core philosophy of performance, accessibility, and developer joy.

Following these standards is absolutely essential for the health and longevity of the project. A consistent codebase is not just cleanerâ€”it's less prone to bugs, easier to debug, and significantly faster for new contributors to understand and start working with. By adhering to these guides, you help ensure that Groundwork remains easy to maintain, extend, and scale for projects of any size, safeguarding its quality for the entire community.

To get started, please select the appropriate guide for the language you are working with. Each document contains specific rules, best practices, and examples tailored to its role within the framework.
