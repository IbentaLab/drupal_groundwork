## 🔍 What Is Groundwork?

Groundwork is a modern Drupal theme built around:

* **Accessibility-first** : Fully WCAG 2.1 AA compliant and aligned with Norwegian digital accessibility laws
* **Performance-first** : Vanilla CSS/JS only — no jQuery, no frameworks, no bloat
* **Build-free** : No Sass, no Webpack, no Node. Just Drupal, Twig, CSS, and JS.
* **Block-based Design** : Designed to work with Layout Builder and the core Block UI
* **Utility-first Styling** : Style anything using reusable CSS classes (like `.p-4`, `.bg-light`, `.text-center`)
* **No-code Friendly** : Editors and builders can use the UI to style blocks with ease

> Groundwork is the theme that lets you build smarter, faster, and more accessibly — using only what Drupal already gives you.
