# üß± Layout Strategy ‚Äì Groundwork Theme

This document explains how layout is structured and managed in the Groundwork theme, ensuring consistency between block placement, Layout Builder usage, and Drupal regions.

## üî§ Acronyms

| Acronym | Meaning                       |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| BSC     | Block Style Component         |
| HSC     | Hybrid Style Component        |
| SDC     | Single Directory Component    |

These terms appear throughout this documentation and refer to styling or layout techniques available via Groundwork's system.

## üéØ General Philosophy

Groundwork separates layout responsibilities into two layers:

- **Content Layout (dynamic)** ‚Üí Powered by **Layout Builder**
- **Structural/Thematic Layout (static)** ‚Üí Managed via **Theme Regions + Block Layout UI**

This allows for flexibility where it's needed and simplicity where it's not.

---

## üî∑ Layout Builder ‚Äì For Content Region

Layout Builder is enabled **only** for the `content` region on content types (e.g., Basic Page, Landing Page).

### Use Cases:
- Flexible page-specific layouts
- Drag-and-drop placement of:
  - Core blocks
  - SDCs (Single Directory Components)
  - Custom blocks
- Visual design for content-rich pages

---

## üüß Theme Regions ‚Äì For All Other Layout Areas

All other layout areas are defined as theme regions in `groundwork.info.yml`, and are managed using Drupal‚Äôs **Block Layout UI**.

### Example Regions:
- `header`, `hero`, `highlighted`, `footer`
- `preface`, `appendix`, `sidebar_first`, `extra`, `supplement`, etc.

### Use Cases:
- Menus, branding, hero areas
- Sitewide banners or announcements
- Sidebars and footer widgets

Place any of the following in these regions:
- Custom blocks
- Reusable SDCs (via plugin or include)
- Views blocks
- Menu blocks

## üß© Summary Table

| Region Type     | How it's Managed         | Example Use                     |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `content`        | Layout Builder           | Per-page layouts with blocks     |
| `header`, `footer`, etc. | Block Layout UI         | Global site structure            |
| `hero`, `highlighted`    | Block Layout UI         | Homepage visuals or announcements |

## üß† Layout Tools in Groundwork

| Tool      | Role                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| BSC       | Visual styling (e.g. padding, color)   |
| HSC       | Layout + styling combo (e.g. flex row) |
| SDC       | Reusable structured component (Twig)   |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on `.grid-cell` and HSCs

All blocks receive a `.grid-cell` class automatically. While this class is generally safe, combining it with:

- `.is-*` grid width classes (e.g. `.is-6--s`)
- or `.grid--equal`

‚Ä¶alongside layout-based HSCs (e.g. `layout-flex-row`) may lead to **layout conflicts**.

---

## üí° Best Practices

- Use **BSCs** (Block Style Components) for styling reusable blocks visually
- Use **HSCs** (Hybrid Style Components) when layout and visual styling are combined
- Use **SDCs** (Single Directory Components) for structured, configurable layout blocks
- Keep global UI in regions, and page-specific design inside Layout Builder
- Use Layout Builder overrides only when a page truly needs it

Groundwork provides both power and structure. This layout strategy gives you the best of both worlds.
